Items for Hire

The program starts by loading a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file of items that are in stock for hire. Listing all items with their prices lined up and an indication (*) if they are currently out on hire. The program allows items to be hired or to return the items that were hired. This program even allows the user to enter a new item as well.
